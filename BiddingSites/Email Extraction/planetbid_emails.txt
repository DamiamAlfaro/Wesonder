1. We want to extract all emails from planetbids from the "Prospective Bidders" tab in order to promote WESONDER there as well.
To do so we need to create a webcrawler that iterates through each planetbids site and jumps straight into the PB section
of the respective bid. 

2. Once we collect the information from the website of planetbids, we need to annotate the name of the project bid that
the sub's email was extracted from, the department of planebtids (who is the awarding body), and the date.
