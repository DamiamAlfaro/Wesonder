1. The first step is to search the web for every municipality's bidding platform by checking where they public their bids. I.e. we need to 
identify if the municipality bids on the following three platforms that we will eventually build a webcrawler on:
	i. Planetbids
	ii. Opengov
	iii. Bidnet Direct
2. We can use the accidental bidding sites for the Awarding Bodies feature.
	i. This is an amazing idea. We are going to iterate through each awarding body, and search and extract their BiddingSites, and 
	display the information as a feature on WeSonder.
